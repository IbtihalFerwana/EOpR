README for the R code of the Optimal Recovery (EOpR) Algorithm for causal inference applications
----------------------------------

1. Try to run the script `application.R` with the current data, to make sure things are working in the right way
2. Expected output: (1) figures of EOpR estimates and Synthetic Control estimates in `/figures` (2) Estimates of EOpR saved as csv file in `/results`

To run the code for your own data
----------------------------------
1. Prepare your data:
	1.1. Make sure your data matrix is in the shape of (NxT), N units as rows and total T periods as columns. Remove any additional column for unit names. 
	1.2. Make sure the treated unit is the first row in the data matrix
	1.3. Place your data in the `/data` folder 
2. Rename variables in script `application.R` 
	2.1. Go to `application.R` script, line 10, rename the (application) variable to be your data file name (without .csv)
	2.2. Line 12, rename the (pre_treat_end_col_name) variable to be the index of your intervention time
3. Make sure the working directory is set to be the current directory
4. Run the `application.R` script
5. Find the outputs in `/figures` and `/results`
